3. Interpretation
-----------------
- The model achieves a 77% accuracy, which is reasonable for credit risk prediction on synthetic data.

- Class 0 (non-default) shows very strong recall (0.91), meaning the model correctly identifies most safe borrowers.

- Class 1 (default) is harder to detect, with a recall of 0.43. This is typical in imbalanced credit datasets where defaults are fewer.

- The AUC score of 0.7877 indicates the model has good overall ability to distinguish between risky and non-risky applicants.

- Precision for Class 1 is 0.67, which means when the model predicts high risk, it is correct most of the time.

- The model performs adequately but may benefit from techniques like class balancing or threshold tuning to further improve default detection.
