LOCAL SHAP EXPLANATIONS FOR THREE INDIVIDUAL APPLICANTS
========================================================

This document provides a text-based explanation of why the model assigned specific risk scores to three selected applicants. 
The explanations are based on SHAP values, which show how each feature contributed to increasing or decreasing the predicted risk.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. APPLICANT 1 – HIGH-RISK PREDICTION
------------------------------------------------------------

The model predicted a high probability of default for this applicant. The following features pushed the prediction upward:

- checking_status_no_checking:

  This was the strongest positive contributor. Having no checking account is treated by the model as a sign of financial instability, increasing risk.

- credit_amount:

  The applicant requested a high loan amount. Larger credit amounts add financial burden and increase the likelihood of repayment failure.

- duration:

  The loan duration was long. Longer repayment periods create more uncertainty and push the risk score higher.

- credit_history_critical/other:

  The applicant has a negative or uncertain credit history, which contributes to a higher predicted default risk.

Overall, multiple strong risk factors pushed the SHAP value upward, resulting in a high-risk classification for this applicant.


------------------------------------------------------------
2. APPLICANT 2 – MEDIUM-RISK PREDICTION
------------------------------------------------------------

This applicant was predicted to have a moderate risk of default. The SHAP values indicate that both positive and negative factors influenced the prediction.

Positive (risk-increasing) contributors:
- duration:
  Slightly long loan duration added some risk.

- credit_amount:
  A medium-sized loan amount increased risk mildly.

- savings_status_<100:
  Low savings contributed to financial vulnerability.

Negative (risk-lowering) contributors:
- employment_status_1-4 years:
  Stable employment slightly reduced the risk.

Interpretation:
Because the applicant has a mix of risky and stable indicators, the SHAP values neither push the score strongly high nor strongly low. 
As a result, the final risk prediction falls in the medium range.


------------------------------------------------------------
3. APPLICANT 3 – LOW-RISK PREDICTION
------------------------------------------------------------

The model predicted a low likelihood of default for this applicant. Several 
features contributed to lowering the risk score:

- checking_status_>200:
  A strong checking account balance was the most influential negative 
  contributor. It indicates good financial stability.

- duration:
  The applicant requested a short loan duration, reducing uncertainty in 
  repayment.

- credit_amount:
  A small loan amount lowered repayment burden, reducing risk.

- credit_history_good:
  Positive credit history contributed significantly to lowering the prediction.

Interpretation:
Strong financial indicators combined to create a large negative SHAP value. 
This pushed the prediction into the low-risk category with high confidence.


Conclusion:
-----------
These three cases demonstrate how the SHAP method explains individual predictions by breaking down the contribution of each feature. 
The model's decisions are consistent with real-world financial reasoning, and the SHAP values provide transparency for each applicant’s assigned risk level.
