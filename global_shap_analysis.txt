GLOBAL SHAP ANALYSIS
====================

Objective:
To interpret the global SHAP values of the credit-risk prediction model and identify the top three most influential drivers contributing to the model’s default risk predictions.

1. Overview of SHAP Results
---------------------------
Global SHAP values summarize how much each feature contributes to the model’s predictions across all applicants. Higher mean SHAP values indicate stronger influence on the final risk output.

Based on the SHAP bar plot, the top three drivers of credit risk are:

1. checking_status_no_checking
2. duration
3. credit_amount

These three features have the highest global SHAP importance scores, meaning they influence the model’s decision-making more than any other variables.

2. Interpretation of Top Three Risk Drivers
-------------------------------------------
1. checking_status_no_checking – Most influential risk driver

- Applicants with no checking account show the highest SHAP contribution toward being predicted as risky.

- The model interprets a lack of a checking account as a signal of limited financial stability or transparency.

- This feature consistently pushes predictions toward higher default probability.

2. duration – Loan duration (second strongest driver)

- Longer loan repayment durations typically increase financial burden.

- The SHAP values show that longer-term loans contribute positively to default risk, while shorter durations reduce the risk.

- This aligns with real-world banking logic, since long repayment periods mean prolonged uncertainty.

3. credit_amount – Total loan amount requested

- Higher loan amounts increase the risk score in the SHAP plot.

- Applicants requesting larger credit amounts tend to have higher repayment risk, especially when not backed by strong financial indicators.

- The model captures this by assigning positive SHAP values to high credit_amount.

3. Key Insights
---------------
- Checking account status is the strongest indicator of risk in this dataset.

- Loan duration and credit amount are major financial factors contributing to repayment difficulty.

- The model heavily relies on financial behavior indicators rather than purely demographic variables.

- These SHAP results align with typical credit-risk logic, meaning the model behaves in a realistic and interpretable manner.

Conclusion:
-----------
The global SHAP analysis shows that checking account availability, loan duration, and credit amount are the primary drivers of the model’s risk predictions. 
These findings confirm that the model is focusing on financially meaningful variables, ensuring reliability and interpretability in real-world credit assessment.
